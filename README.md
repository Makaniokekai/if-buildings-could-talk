### Our Intervention

Our artistic intervention comprises a staggered bridge in the lawn of Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Avery Hall. The structure, built atop the stone bench on the edge of the lawn, is designed to draw attention to the issue of underutilized recreational spaces around New York City. Currently, the Avery lawn is fenced off from all four corners by thick bushes, and on its left side, the said bench. Through connecting the outside of the  to the inside, we propose the symbolic undoing of this access gap.

The issue of park access in New York City was brought to light during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. According to a 2020 New York Times article, over 1.1 million residents of New York City did not have the opportunity to reach any park within a 10-minute walk from their place of residence. The article shed light on how ​​Black and Hispanic families residing in the South Bronx, one of the most impoverished parts of the city, often face a challenging situation in securing green spaces. In contrast, the residents of the Upper West Side, who live within a distance of fewer than five miles, have easy access to a variety of green spaces such as Central Park's lawns and ball fields covering 840 acres, and Riverside Park's playgrounds, dog runs, and scenic waterfront views, spread over 310 acres. 

Given this stark inequity, underutlizing perfectly usable green spaces like the Avery Hall lawn feels like a wasted privilege. Our intervention is a call to action for the Columbia community to acknowledge the issue and as well as a small step(s) towards amending it.
